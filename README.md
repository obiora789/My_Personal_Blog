# My Personal Blog

This is a full-functioning blog developed using Python and Flask. The blog has basic functionalities such as authentication, registration, and posting of articles and comments.\
The admin can create, edit, and delete posts, while other registered users can view and comment on posts created by the admin.\
The first user registered in the database is automatically given admin privileges (So you have to be careful üòâ).

## Getting Started

To get started with this Flask Blog, you will need to have Python 3.5 or above installed on your computer. You will also need to clone this repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-blog.git
```

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment. Activate the virtual environment and install the required dependencies using the following commands:

```
cd flask-blog
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuring the Application

Before you can run the Flask Blog, you will need to configure the application by creating a `.env` file in the root directory. The `.env` file should contain the following environment variables:

```
APP_SECRET=<your_app_secret_key>
LINKED-IN=<your_linkedin_url>
GIT-HUB=<your_github_url>
TWITTER_=<your_twitter_url>
NAME=<your_name>
RESUME=<your_online_resume>
MY_EMAIL=<your_email>
EMAIL_PASSWORD=<your_password>
OTHER_EMAIL=<other_emails_you_may_have>
SECOND_EMAIL=<other_emails_you_may_have>
DATABASE=<your_database_url>
```

- `APP_SECRET` is a secret key used by Flask to sign session cookies.
- `DATABASE` is the name of your database file.

## Running the Application

To run the Flask Blog, navigate to the project directory and activate the virtual environment using the following command:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, start the Flask application using the following command:

```
flask run
```
If you make use of PyCharm, the instructions above may not be necessary. Simply open the project in Pycharm, install requirements and click the "‚ñ∂Ô∏è" button in main.py file. I used PyCharm 2022 in developing this blog.\
You can then access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

## Using the Application

To use the Flask Blog, you will need to register for an account. Once you have registered, you can log in and create, edit, and delete your posts. You can also view posts created by other users on the home page.
